# -ffreestanding: Don't assume standard library exists, or main() is the

## Explicit make rules

# Special (properly called "automatic") variables to remember:
# $@ - name of rule target
# $< - first prerequisite
# $^ - all prerequisites

# Being the first target, running make without any
# arguments will first run kernel8.img -- our final output -- which will
# cascade to generate all of its dependencies if necessary.

# Convert our linked ELF binary into a raw one (termed "binary")
$(BUILD_DIR)/$(TARGET): $(BUILD_DIR)/kernel
	aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu-objcopy -O binary $^ $@
# Append filesystem to the end of the kernel binary
	dd if=lib/os.img >> $@

# Link our object files without including the C standard library functions.
$(BUILD_DIR)/kernel: $(SRC_DIR)/link_script.lds $(OBJS)
	$(LD) -nostdlib -T $< -o $@ $(OBJS)

# Define patterns that will be implicit rules for our various source
# and derived files

# We need .c.o and .s.o extensions because we need to have disambiguity
# in our rules, we can't have make just figure out that a .o rule only
# applies to .s files or .c files.
$(BUILD_DIR)/%.c.o: $(SRC_DIR)/%.c
# Create build/ if it doesn't exist already
	mkdir -p $(dir $@)	
	$(CC) $(CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@

# How to turn .s files into .o files
$(BUILD_DIR)/%.s.o: $(SRC_DIR)/%.s
# Create build/ if it doesn't exist already
	mkdir -p $(dir $@)
	$(CC) -c $< -o $@

# Don't look for files with the name of these targets, just run them.
# This prevents cases where a equally named file will prevent the tasks
# from running because make thinks the file is unchanged and thus the
# target doesn't need to be run.
